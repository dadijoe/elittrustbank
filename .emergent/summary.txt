The previous AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive web banking platform from scratch, addressing various feature requests and bug fixes. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with core authentication and a professional homepage, then progressively adding customer and admin functionalities. Key achievements include a secure sign-up process with admin approval, a robust transaction system handling internal, domestic, and international transfers with mandatory admin review, and a manual credit/debit feature for admins with backdating capabilities. Significant effort was put into UI/UX redesigns for both the homepage and customer dashboard, ensuring mobile responsiveness and a modern aesthetic. Bug fixes for transaction approval and date handling were critical. Recently, real-time data updates for the customer dashboard, admin force logout functionality, dynamic monthly summaries, number formatting, and refined header responsiveness were implemented. The work is largely complete, with the final task focusing on refining the live graph in the monthly summary.

<product_requirements>
The goal was to build a full-stack, elegant, and secure web banking platform for customers and bank staff.
**Design:** Clean, modern interface with deep navy, crisp white, gold accents. Responsive grids, subtle micro-interactions. Homepage with hero, header, footer, CTAs (Open an Account, Login Securely). Bank with Confidence section with animated stats.
**Customer Panel:** Secure sign-up (SSN/TIN, mandatory code 28032803, admin approval). Default checking/savings accounts. User dashboard: real-time balances, transaction history, downloadable PDF statements. Transaction features: internal, domestic, international transfers (SWIFT/IBAN); all transactions require admin review/approval.
**Admin Panel:** Admin login, full user management (sign-up approval with SSN/TIN verification). Transaction Control Center: view/approve/decline pending transactions, manual credit/debit (no admin label), custom transaction date/time. Additional tools: freeze/unfreeze accounts, enforce limits, audit logs, suspicious activity alerts, real-time reporting. Content tools: homepage banner, blog/news, customer broadcast.
**Technical Notes:** Input forms to accept long text, full mobile responsiveness, fast loading, secure authentication. Backend logic for admin approval queues. Clean UI/UX across all devices.
**Current State of Product:** The application has a functional user and admin panel. The homepage and customer dashboard are redesigned and responsive. Core banking functionalities like transfers, manual credit/debit, and transaction approvals are implemented and largely working. Real-time updates, admin session management (force logout), and number formatting are partially integrated.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT tokens, Admin/Customer roles, Admin approval workflows.
- **UI/UX Design:** Tailwind CSS for styling, responsive design principles.
- **Real-time Updates:** Polling mechanism for live data on dashboards.
- **Database Management:** MongoDB for user and transaction data.
- **API Design:** RESTful API with  prefix for all backend routes.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture:


- ****: This is the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for user authentication, account management, transaction processing (transfers, manual credit/debit), and admin functionalities like user approval, transaction approval, and session management. It interacts with the MongoDB database.
    - **Changes made:**
        - Initial implementation of all core endpoints (auth, user, admin, transactions).
        - Fixed a 404 error by adding a root endpoint .
        - Modified  logic for international transfers and self-transfers.
        - Updated  model and manual transaction endpoint to handle .
        - Updated  and  models, and transfer/approval logic for  and self-transfers.
        - Implemented security enhancements by removing hardcoded credentials and adding force logout logic with JWT iat (issued at timestamp).
        - Enhanced user authentication checks for force logout.
        - Updated dashboard endpoint to fetch fresh user data for real-time balances.

- ****: This is the main React component, serving as the central hub for the frontend. It contains the  for authentication state, various routes using , and all the major components like , , , , , and various modals.
    - **Changes made:**
        - Initial setup of the application structure, including routing and basic UI.
        - Major redesigns for  and  components to match provided mockups, including card layouts, monthly summaries, and transaction lists.
        - Added admin dashboard components for Credit/Debit Account and Active Sessions tabs, including their forms and display logic.
        - Updated  to handle loading states and suspicious login popups more effectively.
        - Implemented number formatting utility and applied it across various financial displays.
        - Enhanced responsiveness of the dashboard header and implemented a fully responsive sidebar menu.
        - Modified transfer form to include Select Account dropdown and support self-transfers.
        - Integrated real-time data polling for customer dashboard graph and statistics.
        - Updated header navigation links, adding Service Unavailable and Suspicious Login modals.

- ****: Contains global styles for the React application, often leveraged by Tailwind CSS for custom classes or base styles.
    - **Changes made:** Initial setup for basic global styling, complementing the Tailwind CSS configuration.

- ****: Lists all Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    - **Changes made:** Updated to include all necessary packages as new features/libraries were introduced (e.g., , , , , ).

- ****: Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend.
    - **Changes made:** Updated as new frontend libraries were introduced (e.g., , chart libraries).

- ** and **: Environment variable files for backend (MONGO_URL, SECRET_KEY) and frontend (REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL).
    - **Changes made:**  was added to . No other protected variables were modified.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the fix for the monthly graph on the user dashboard to properly show rising income (credits) and falling expenses (debits) with correct function-wise representation.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on updating the app to automatically format all large numbers by inserting commas or separators and ensuring decimal points are correctly placed. This formatting is to be applied consistently across all financial figures and numerical displays. Simultaneously, the user dashboard header is being made very responsive. Critically, the monthly summary diagram is being fixed to accurately represent money credited as income and debited as expenses, reacting to these transactions with appropriate visual rises and falls. The last recorded action was 5. Fix the monthly graph to properly show rising income and falling expenses within the context of this larger formatting and responsiveness task. This implies number formatting and header responsiveness are likely in progress or mostly done, with the diagram logic being the immediate focus.
